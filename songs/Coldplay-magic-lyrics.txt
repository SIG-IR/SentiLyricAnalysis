Call it magic, call it true
I call it magic when I'm with you
And I just got broken, broken into two
Still I call it magic, when I'm next to you

And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Call it magic, cut me into two
And with all your magic, I disappear from view
And I can't get over, can't get over you
Still, I call it magic, such a precious jewel

And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

And I don't, And I don't, And I don't, And I don't
No I don't, it's true
I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't, No, I don't
Want anybody else but you

Wanna fall, fall so far
I wanna fall, fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
I call it magic

And if you were to ask me
After all that we've been through
Still believe in magic?
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Yes, I do
Of course I do
